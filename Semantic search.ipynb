       "'Dancing Philosophy. The project is based on an intensive collaboration between a dancer and a philosopher to explore the question of desire, in its multiple links to practices of recognition.\\n It also associates a choreographer, specialised in Laban Kinetography and expert in Functional Analysis of the Body in Dancing Movement, a performance artist, director and graphic designer as well as a professor in performing arts and digital humanities.\\n Through this collaboration, we would like to develop analytical tools and pedagogical practices that allow an innovative approach to provoke the individual’s recognition of “self” in relation to “other”.   The idea is to work together first in a dialectical exchange on the points and issues of the main theme. Then, we will take the materials and stories that have emerged and examine them in an improvisational work where the “body in movement” becomes the subject, the object and the tool of the research. The idea is to move from isolated thought  to a singular bodily experience, which allows one to awaken and experience the sensations and intensities of recognition and reciprocity.\\n In addition to dancer and choreographer, Cosetta Graffione, and philosopher and researcher Stefania Ferrando, this collaborative project is hosted by CADMIUM compagnie, a structure that develops multidisciplinary artistic productions and involves work with Irénée Blin, choreographer, dancer and teacher, specialized in Laban Kinetography and expert in Functional Analysis of the Body in the Danced Movement (AFCMD), Daniele Marranca, artist performer, director and graphic designer and Delphine Riss, project manager.\\n The projet involves also Clarisse Bardiot, researcher in artistic performances and digital humanities at the Polytechnic University of Haut-de-France, who develops the MemoRekall software, a structure that develops multidisciplinary artistic productions. This exchange between choreographic research, on the one hand, and philosophical research, on the other, aims to generate a new understanding of desire and relationships, experimenting with new ways of knowing through words and dance, and creating a choreography.\\n Our goals are also to find a more embodied and concrete answer to these questions \"what is desire?\" \"what are human relationships?\", \"does the relationship constrain the freedom of the individual or does it support this freedom? Under what conditions does one or the other happen?\". Can dance help us to think, and thus to become emancipated? Can it help the philosopher to feel free? \\n The aim is to move away from the traditional relationship between dance and philosophy, in which dance tends to illustrate thought and interpret ideas in a \"spectacular\" form. The project now try to observe and analyse what happens in the relationship between the philosopher and the dancer, to experience dance in its capacity to help the philosopher to think, to experience \"thinking through the body\" and, the same time, from a choreographic point of view, to see how philosophical words could be embodied and open up new horizons for contemporary dance and a non-specialised audience.'"
